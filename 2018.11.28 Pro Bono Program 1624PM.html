<p>The Center works with pro bono attorneys around the world to advance and defend reproductive rights. From serving as co-counsel on a U.S. Supreme Court case, to authoring submissions to the United Nations, law firms have been instrumental to the Center’s success. Pro bono lawyers work on a range of issues including child marriage, maternal health, access to contraception, and safe and legal abortion.</p>
